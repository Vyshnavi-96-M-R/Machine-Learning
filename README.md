# Machine-Learning
Build a model to detect credit card fraud
Perform data cleaning
Deal with missing and duplicate values if present
Check Whether the classes are balanced or not
Check the performance of models without dealing with imbalanced classes
Explain the use of under-sampling and over-sampling for imbalanced classification
Train the model using several classification models and find the best model after under-sampling the dataset
Train the model using several classification models and find the best model after over-sampling the dataset
Use hyperparameter tuning to find best parameters for the algorithm
Evaluate the model using various classification evaluation metrics
